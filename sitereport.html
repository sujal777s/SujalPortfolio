            <h2>My Web Development Journey</h2>
            <p>The web development module has turned out to be a challenge but an interesting one, having made me interact with a new world that is coding and designing. At first, the syntax of both HTML & CSS used to seem complex but as I practiced learning new concepts I guess I improved on them.</p>
            
            <h2>Design Journey</h2>
            <p>This website went through several design updates based on different styles that come with UI selections above. The last design was due to some effort and the feedback that was gathered from the users.</p>
            <p>Color Scheme: Concerning the choice of colors, I tried few combinations and opted for the blue and white colors. Blue is less stimulating so it can be ideal for a portfolio site since the visitors will tend to have confidence in the professional that they are viewing the portfolio of. Fonts: For the body text, I chose ‘Helvetica Neue’ based on its sleek and clean appearance and its high legibility, and for the headings I opted for ‘Arial,’ because it has a certain aesthetic appeal.</p>
            <p>Layout: For the project page, the web developer chose a masonry grid layout, useful to display projects in a dynamic manner. As mentioned, the contact form is supposed to be functional and intuitive so that it matches the overall concept of the site.</p>
            <p>Animations: I have also incorporated some animations in my website using keyframes; where the Instagram and Gmail icons stages float for 3 seconds before returning to their original position and this keeps on cycling.</p>
            
            <h2>Technical Aspects</h2>
            <p>HTML & CSS: I also grasped how to use Flexbox and CSS Grid to achieve complicated positioning of elements on the page. One of the biggest struggles was specifically how to maintain compatibility between the different browsers.</p>
            
            <h2>Debugging</h2>
            <p>One of the most challenging aspects of front-end development was debugging CSS problems. In many instances working with different applications, I used forums and documentation as the main sources to solve issues.</p>
            
            <h2>Validation</h2>
            <p>All the HTML and CSS files have been validated properly to ensure no issues have been faced.</p>
